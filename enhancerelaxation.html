                1 . What Is Relaxation ?
            </div>

            <div class="container p-5">

                <p>Maybe you are familiar with relaxation techniques, and you know about the various ways to bring about
                    the
                    relaxation response, or perhaps you may be wondering, "what is relaxation?" Relaxation is the act of
                    relaxing the mind and body, and can also be defined as the state of being relaxed. During a
                    relaxation
                    exercise (such as progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, meditation, or another relaxation
                    technique) muscle tension decreases, blood pressure goes down, the mind becomes calm, and the
                    harmful
                    effects of prolonged stress are counteracted.

                    The "relaxation response" is the opposite of the stress response.

                    The stress response is also known as the fight-or-flight response. According to Herbert Benson, in
                    his
                    book "The Relaxation Response," we evoke the fight-or-flight response all the time, but "modern
                    society
                    does not socially accept the fighting or running naturally associated with it."

                    This means that we are not appropriately using the fight-or-flight response for survival. We can't
                    use
                    the response as intended - imagine what would happen if you encountered a stressful situation, such
                    as
                    an argument at work, and responded by physically fighting or running away? That does not work very
                    well.

                    The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are in fight-or-flight mode. Over time this can
                    have
                    all kinds of negative effects (which are the symptoms of stress).</p>

                2 . 5 Reasons Why You Need To Learn How To Stretch Regularly ?
            </div>

            <img class="d-block m-auto mt-5" src="IMGS/problems/enhancerelaxation/relax3.jpg" width="35%">

            <div class="container p-5">
                <div class="h3">1. Your body will thank you</div>
                <p>Stress causes a numerous amount of issues for your body. High blood pressure, headaches, muscle
                    tension,
                    ulcers, and weakened immune system are just a few of the many health issues stress can trigger.
                    Relaxation helps counteract these effects by giving your body a chance to calm down!
                </p>
                <div class="h3">2. You will think more quickly and clearer</div>
                <p>Continuous stress will do some pretty unpleasant things to our mind. Science has linked many diseases
                    to
                    frayed nerves. Paranoia, depression, several syndromes and even just a general feeling of not
                    thinking
                    straight can come from too much stress in your life. It all comes down to how you think and can
                    cause
                    you to make bad decisions. By adding some you time and allowing yourself to relax you can put your
                    troubles on hold and let your mind recover. If your mind is calm, you can evaluate your daily task,
                    projects and problems more quickly than if you’re burdened with unnecessary and often unrelated
                    worries.
                </p>
                <div class="h3">3. Your emotions will be more leveled out</div>
                <p>We all plead guilty to having at least one crazy outburst of emotions-whether you care to admit it or
                    not! When stress has you completely overwhelmed and tired, you tend to operate with less conscious
                    control over your emotional response. This can lead to you lashing out at the people you care about,
                    or
                    even upsetting strangers (that’s probably why the barista gave you the wrong coffee order). Relaxing
                    will allow for better control over your emotions. When you are calm and relaxed, it allows you to
                    examine your emotions without acting on them and helps you ensure your emotional response is fitting
                    for
                    the situation. </p>
                <div class="h3">4. You will be more efficient at work</div>
                <p>Depending on your workplace, it can be very difficult to stay relaxed during your workday. Between
                    deadlines, frivolous meetings, annoying co-workers and difficult customers, it feels almost
                    impossible
                    to keep a cool head. This in turn can lead to you becoming one of those annoying co-workers, making
                    work
                    an even worse place to be. Although it is easier said than done, it is best to stay relaxed. You
                    will
                    have a better sense of reasoning and problem solving (recharged mind). You can also bank on enjoying
                    more energy and better concentration when you have the feel good mentality. Your relaxed demeanor
                    can
                    even encourage your fellow co-workers to follow suit and create a more pleasant work environment.
                </p>
                <div class="h3">5. You’ll help boost those around you</div>
                <p>Stress has a tendency to spread. The domino effect of stress starts with one person showing signs of
                    stress, leading to an entire group of people’s minds to thinking about all the things causing them
                    concern. Emotions and attitudes, good or bad, are contagious and have energy to them. The best way
                    to
                    combat stress in a group is to try your best to relax. It’s amazing how far a smile and a few
                    encouraging words can relax someone that is feeling stressed!

                    Adding relaxation to our routine seems like a luxury just out of our reach, but you would be
                    surprised
                    at how easy it to de-stress your life! Some quick and easy ways to add relaxation to your life
                    include
                    listening to your favorite music, reading a book, enjoying a glass of wine after work, and my
                    personal
                    favorite, lighting an aromatherapy candle. Another great way to relax is to visit your local Planet
                    Beach, which offers an array of push of the button relaxation services. My absolute favorite Planet
                    Beach relaxation service is the DreamWave Massage-in just 20 minutes I get a massage like no other,
                    as
                    it reduces stress and fatigue, relieves pain, promotes better sleep and increases better blood
                    circulation! Taking 20-45 minutes 2 to 3 times a week can help reduce your stress and better your
                    health
                    overall. How can you say you don’t have time for that?</p>

            <div class="container h1 text-primary">
                3 . How to Relax More Effectively
            </div>



            <div class="container p-5">
                <div class="h3">Make Time</div>
                <p>Instead of fitting relaxation in as and when you can, sit down and carve out some regular calendar
                    time
                    for it, whether it be every evening before bed, getting up an hour early to watch the sunrise, or
                    carving out one weekend each month to do only things that relax you.

                    When you do this, you associate the activity with the proper importance, which means you will take
                    it
                    more seriously and be less likely to skip it.</p>
                <div class="h3">Try Biofeedback</div>
                <p>Biofeedback is the process of training your body to control various processes. Once learned, you can
                    use
                    it to lower your blood pressure, reduce muscle tension and slow your heartbeat, all of which will
                    help
                    you to keep your stress levels at bay.

                    It might sound too good to be true, but it is very possible with the right training and it could
                    completely transform your life.</p>

                <div class="h3">Journal</div>
                <p>Journaling is a very effective way to relax. Not only does it give you a way to be creative, but it
                    enables you to get all of your thoughts out on the page, process them better, and leave them behind.

                    Journaling before bed, so you can put your worries to rest is great for helping you get a good
                    night’s
                    sleep, in particular!</p>

                <div class="h3">Meditate</div>
                <p>Meditation is another technique that can train your brain to behave in ways that are more conducive
                    to
                    relaxation.

                    When you meditate, you learn to live in the moment, and when you live in the moment, you aren’t busy
                    stressing about a future that might never happen or turning over past problems in your brain, which
                    means you are completely free to relax and enjoy what is happening right now.</p>
                <div class="h3">Exercise</div>
                <p>You might think that exercise is energizing, rather than relaxing, but it can actually do both!

                    When you exercise, your body releases positive endorphins that make you feel amazing, so whether you
                    want to beat the blues or avoid stressing about the latest problem, hitting the gym is usually a
                    good
                    idea.</p>
                <div class="h3">Do What You Love</div>
                <p>Of course, all that being said, there is no point learning to meditate or whatever if the process of
                    doing so actually stresses you out more – you need to do what works for you. Therefore, try as many
                    relaxation techniques as possible, but if you get calmer by reading a good book or playing with your
                    pets, then it’s perfectly fine to do those instead. It’s your life. So do what works for you.

                    Relaxation time is not optional, so pick one of the ideas above and start relaxing today!</p>
