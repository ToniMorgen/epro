                1 . What Is Joint Pain? ?
            </div>

            <div class="container p-5">

                <p>Joint discomfort is common and usually felt in the hands, feet, hips, knees, or spine. Pain may be
                    constant or it can come and go. Sometimes the joint can feel stiff, achy, or sore. Some patients
                    complain of a burning, throbbing, or “grating” sensation. In addition, the joint may feel stiff in
                    the
                    morning but loosen up and feel better with movement and activity. However, too much activity could
                    make
                    the pain worse.

                    Joint pain may affect the function of the joint, and can limit a person’s ability to do basic tasks.
                    Severe joint pain can affect the quality of life. Treatment should focus not only on pain but also
                    on
                    the affected activities and functions.</p>

                2 . What Causes Joint Pain?
            </div>

            <div class="container p-5">
                <p>The most common causes of chronic pain in joints are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Osteoarthritis, a common type of arthritis, happens over time when the cartilage, the protective
                        cushion in between the bones, wears away. The joints become painful and stiff. Osteoarthritis
                        develops slowly and usually occurs during middle age.</li>
                    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that causes swelling and pain in the joints. Often the
                        joints become deformed (usually occurring in the fingers and wrists).</li>
                    <li>Gout is a painful condition where crystals from the body collect in the joint, causing severe
                        pain
                        and swelling. This usually occurs in the big toe.</li>
                    <li>Bursitis is caused by overuse. It is usually found in the hip, knee, elbow, or shoulder.</li>
                    <li>Viral infections, rash, or fever may make joint movement painful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Injuries, such as broken bones or sprains
                    </li>
                    <li>Tendinitis is an inflammation of the tendons, or the flexible bands that connect bone and
                        muscle. It
                        is typically seen in the elbow, heel, or shoulder and is usually caused by overuse.

                <div class="w-50 px-5 haha">
                    <h3>1. What is disc syndrome?</h3>
                    <p>What is disc syndrome? The intervertebral discs are protective shock-absorbing pads between the
                        bones
                        of the spine (vertebrae). The discs in the neck and low back can bulge or rupture over time due
                        to
                        wear and tear and pinch the nearby nerve roots. If a disc pinches the nerve in the neck, it
                        could
                        potentially cause pain in the neck.
                        <br><br>
                        Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) is a back condition in which an intervertebral disc or disc
                        fragments
                        are displaced at any level of the spine: lumbar, cervical, or thoracic. IVDS can cause chronic
                        pain
                        in
                        the back, usually made worse by prolonged sitting or bending.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. How can Chiropractic care help those with disc syndrome?</h3>
                    <p>Chiropractic care can be a great way to manage and relieve Disc Syndrome’s symptoms. Chiropractic
                        care provides patients a safe, non-invasive alternative to take a step closer to their health
                        goals.
                        Our doctors at ACC will perform a consultation, examination, and if necessary, refer you out for
                        diagnostic imaging such as X-ray or MRI. Based on the findings of our Chiropractic exam and
                        consultation, your doctor of Chiropractic will elect a suitable type of treatment for your
                        specific
                        conditions.</p>

                    <h3>1 . What causes lower back pain?</h3>
                    <p>Many injuries, conditions and diseases can cause lower back pain. They include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strains and sprains: Back strains and sprains are the most common cause of back pain. You
                            can
                            injure muscles, tendons or ligaments by lifting something too heavy or not lifting safely.
                            Some
                            people strain their back by sneezing, coughing, twisting or bending over.</li>
                        <li>Fractures: The bones in the spine can break during an accident, like a car crash or a fall.
                            Certain conditions (such as spondylolysis or osteoporosis) increase the risk of fractures.
                        </li>
                        <li>Disk problems: Disks cushion the vertebrae (small spinal bones). Disks can bulge from their
                            position in the spine and press on a nerve. They can also tear (herniated disk). With age,
                            disks
                            can get flatter and offer less protection (degenerative disk disease).
                        </li>
                        <li>Spondylolisthesis: This condition causes the vertebrae in the spine to slip out of place.
                            Spondylolisthesis leads to low back pain and often leg pain as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2 . Lower back pain treatments</h3>
                    <p>Lower back pain usually gets better with rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers. After a
                        few
                        days of rest, you can start to get back to your normal activities. Staying active increases
                        blood
                        flow to the area and helps you heal.

                        Other treatments for lower back pain depend on the cause. They include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medications: Your provider may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
                            prescription drugs to relieve pain. Other medications relax muscles and prevent back spasms.
                        </li>
                        <li>Physical therapy (PT): PT can strengthen muscles so they can support your spine. PT also
                            improves flexibility and helps you avoid another injury.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hands-on manipulation: Several “hands-on” treatments can relax tight muscles, reduce pain
                            and
                            improve posture and alignment. Depending on the cause of pain, you may need osteopathic
                            manipulation or chiropractic adjustments. Massage therapy can also help with back pain
                            relief
                            and restore function.
                        </li>

                </div>
                <div class="w-50 px-5 haha">
                    <h3>1 . Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>Sciatica pain can be almost anywhere along the nerve pathway. It's especially likely to follow a
                        path
                        from the low back to the buttock and the back of a thigh and calf.

                        The pain can vary from a mild ache to a sharp, burning pain. Sometimes it can feel like a jolt
                        or
                        electric shock. It can be worse when coughing or sneezing or sitting a long time. Usually,
                        sciatica
                        affects only one side of the body.

                        Some people also have numbness, tingling or muscle weakness in the leg or foot. One part of the
                        leg
                        can be in pain, while another part can feel numb.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Prevention</h3>
                    <p>It's not always possible to prevent sciatica, and the condition can come back. To protect your
                        back:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exercise regularly. To keep the back strong, work the core muscles — the muscles in the
                            abdomen
                            and lower back needed for good posture and alignment. A health care provider can recommend
                            activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep good posture when sitting. Choose a seat with good lower back support, armrests and a
                            swivel base. For better low back support, place a pillow or rolled towel in the small of the
                            back to keep its normal curve. Keep knees and hips level.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use your body correctly. When standing for long periods, rest one foot on a stool or small
                            box
                            from time to time. When lifting something heavy, let your legs do the work. Hold the load
                            close
                            to your body. Don't lift and twist at the same time. Find someone to help lift heavy or
                            awkward
                            things.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>


            </div>


            <div class="d-flex p-5" id="C4">

                <div class="w-50 px-5 haha">
                    <h3>1. Causes</h3>
                    <p>Because the neck supports the weight of the head, it can be at risk of injuries and conditions
                        that
                        cause pain and restrict motion. Neck pain causes include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Muscle strains. Overuse, such as too many hours hunched over a computer or a smartphone,
                            often
                            triggers muscle strains. Even minor things, such as reading in bed, can strain neck muscles.
                        </li>
                        <li>Worn joints. As with other joints in the body, neck joints tend to wear with age. In
                            response to
                            this wear and tear, the body often forms bone spurs that can affect joint motion and cause
                            pain.
                        </li>
                        <li>Nerve compression. Herniated disks or bone spurs in the vertebrae of the neck can press on
                            the
                            nerves branching out from the spinal cord.
                        </li>
                        <li>Injuries. Rear-end auto collisions often result in whiplash injury. This occurs when the
                            head
                            jerks backward and then forward, straining the soft tissues of the neck.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2 . Prevention</h3>
                    <p>Most neck pain is associated with poor posture combined with age-related wear and tear. To help
                        prevent neck pain, keep your head centered over your spine. Some simple changes in your daily
                        routine may help. Consider trying to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use good posture. When standing and sitting, be sure your shoulders are in a straight line
                            over
                            your hips and your ears are directly over your shoulders. When using cell phones, tablets
                            and
                            other small screens, keep your head up and hold the device straight out rather than bending
                            your
                            neck to look down at the device.
                        </li>
                        <li>Take frequent breaks. If you travel long distances or work long hours at your computer, get
                            up,
                            move around, and stretch your neck and shoulders.
                        </li>
                        <li>Adjust your desk, chair and computer so that the monitor is at eye level. Knees should be
                            slightly lower than hips. Use your chair's armrests.

                4 . Therapeutic methods to help restore joints
            </div>
            <div class="container p-5">
                <div class="h3"> Here are the clinic's 8 best treatments:</div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Massage – Sports therapists suggest massaging the muscles around the sprained joint not just for
                        relief but make the muscles stronger. It is best done with a liniment or a topical agent. Light
                        massages are advised when there is still swelling. If heavy swelling is present, do not massage
                        affected area.</li>
                    <li>Cryotherapy – If the muscles around the joint are still swelling, cryotherapy is best. Ice on
                        the
                        affected area reduces tissue swelling. The minute there is pain on the joint, ice packs for 15
                        minutes every hour is the best way to speed up the healing. This is very vital for relief of
                        joint
                        pain. Avoid ice burns by not placing ice directly on skin though. Wrap ice in a towel, washcloth
                        or
                        put it in an icepack.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hydrotherapy – warm water can also do miracles for joint pain. Warm water stimulates blood flow.
                        A
                        warm bath can be best for your knee joints. Immerse affected area in warm water and massage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Medicine – For severe pain, you can take medicines like ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory
                        medications
                        to relieve joint pain. These will not speed up the healing process though but will definitely
                        help
                        with the pain. Muscle relaxants are also good to reduce spasms.
                    </li>
                    <li>Exercise – Movement for the joint is good for recovery. BUT not all exercises are good for the
                        joint
                        and the muscles around it. Here are some exercises which are good for the knee and here are some
                        exercises which are not good for your knee. Consult a therapist to check when you can start
                        exercising after an injury.
                    </li>
                    <li>Food Intake – Although your body is meant to heal on its own, giving it with proper nutrition
                        will
                        certainly boost healing. Research has shown that proper nutrition can promote faster healing.
                        Foods
                        rich in vitamin C like citrus, berries, kiwi and broccoli are good sources. Vitamin A foods like
                        carrots, spinach and sweet potatoes promote the production of white blood cells which help fight
                        infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Physical Therapy – For major injuries, do not neglect to consult a physical therapist. They
                        specialize in joint and muscle recovery.
                    </li>
                    <li>Compression Garments – Compression garments are best for restricting movement. Movement should
                        be
                        restricted for injured joints. BUT too much restriction will also not promote healing.
                        Compression
                        garments are designed to enhance blood circulation in the affected area. It can help stimulate
                        oxygen delivery to the muscles and augment airflow. Check our line of compression garments,
