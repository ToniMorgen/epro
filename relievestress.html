                1 . What is Stress ?
            </div>

            <div class="container p-5">

                <p>Stress is your body’s reaction to pressure from a certain situation or event. It can be a physical,
                    mental, or emotional reaction.

                    We all deal with stress at some point in our lives. Maybe it’s your job, a family illness, or money
                    troubles. These are common triggers. According to a recent study, about half of all Americans say
                    they’re dealing with moderate stress.

                    Not all stress is bad. It can make you more aware of things around you and keep you more focused. In
                    some cases stress can give you strength and help you get more done.</p>

                3 . Ways to relieve stress
            </div>



            <div class="container p-5">
                <h3>Tips to manage stressful situations</h3>
                <p>It might surprise you to learn that biological stress is a fairly recent discovery. It wasn’t until
                    the late 1950s that endocrinologist Hans Selye first identified and documented stress. <br>

                    Symptoms of stress existed long before Selye, but his discoveries led to new research that has
                    helped millions cope with stress. We’ve compiled a list of the top 10 ways to relieve stress.</p>
                <h3>Listen to music</h3>
                <p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try taking a break and listening to relaxing
                    music. Playing calm music has a positive effect on the brain and body, can lower blood pressure, and
                    reduce cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. <br>

                    We recommend cello master Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach, but if classical really isn’t your thing, try
                    listening to ocean or nature sounds. It may sound cheesy, but they have similar relaxing effects to
                    music.</p>
                <h3>Talk it out with a friend</h3>
                <p>When you’re feeling stressed, take a break to call a friend and talk about your problems. Good
                    relationships with friends and loved ones are important to any healthy lifestyle. <br>

                    They’re especially important when you’re under a lot of stress. A reassuring voice, even for a
                    minute, can put everything in perspective.</p>
                <h3>Talk yourself through it</h3>
                <p>Sometimes calling a friend is not an option. If this is the case, talking calmly to yourself can be
                    the next best thing. <br>

                    Don’t worry about seeming crazy — just tell yourself why you’re stressed out, what you have to do to
                    complete the task at hand, and most importantly, that everything will be okay.</p>
                <h3>Eat right</h3>
                <p>Stress levels and a proper diet are closely related. When we’re overwhelmed, we often forget to eat
                    well and resort to using sugary, fatty snack foods as a pick-me-up. <br>

                    Try to avoid sugary snacks and plan ahead. Fruits and vegetables are always good, and fish with high
                    levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the symptoms of stress. A tuna sandwich
                    really is brain food.</p>
                <h3>Laugh it off</h3>
                <p>Laughter releases endorphins that improve mood and decrease levels of the stress-causing hormones
                    cortisol and adrenaline. Laughing tricks your nervous system into making you happy. <br>

                    Our suggestion: watch some classic Monty Python skits like “The Ministry of Silly Walks.” Those
                    Brits are so hilarious, you’ll soon be cracking up, rather than cracking up.</p>
                <h3>Drink tea</h3>
                <p>A large dose of caffeine causes a short-term spike in blood pressure. It may also cause your
                    hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to go into overdrive. <br>

                    Instead of coffee or energy drinks, try green tea. It has less than half the caffeine of coffee and
                    contains healthy antioxidants, as well as theanine, an amino acid that has a calming effect on the
                    nervous system.</p>
                <h3>Be mindful</h3>
                <p>Most of the tips we’ve suggested provide immediate relief, but there are also many lifestyle changes
                    that can be more effective in the long run. The concept of “mindfulness” is a large part of
                    meditative and somatic approaches to mental health and has become popular recently. <br>

                    From yoga and tai chi to meditation and Pilates, these systems of mindfulness incorporate physical
                    and mental exercises that prevent stress from becoming a problem. Try joining a class.</p>
                <h3>Exercise (even for a minute)</h3>
                <p>Exercise doesn’t necessarily mean power lifting at the gym or training for a marathon. A short walk
                    around the office or simply standing up to stretch during a break at work can offer immediate relief
                    in a stressful situation. <br>

                    Getting your blood moving releases endorphins and can improve your mood almost instantaneously.</p>
                <h3>Sleep better</h3>
                <p>Everyone knows stress can cause you to lose sleep. Unfortunately, lack of sleep is also a key cause
                    of stress. This vicious cycle causes the brain and body to get out of whack and only gets worse with
                    time. <br>

                    Make sure to get the doctor-recommended seven to eight hours of sleep. Turn the TV off earlier, dim
                    the lights, and give yourself time to relax before going to bed. It may be the most effective stress
                    buster on our list.</p>
                <h3>Breathe easy</h3>
                <p>The advice “take a deep breath” may seem like a cliché, but it holds true when it comes to stress.
                    For centuries, Buddhist monks have been conscious of deliberate breathing during meditation. <br>

                    For an easy three- to five-minute exercise, sit up in your chair with your feet flat on the floor
                    and hands on top of your knees. Breathe in and out slowly and deeply, concentrating on your lungs as
                    they expand fully in your chest. <br>

                    While shallow breathing causes stress, deep breathing oxygenates your blood, helps center your body,
                    and clears your mind.</p>
